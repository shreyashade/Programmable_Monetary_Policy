# Enhanced Economic Model Design for CBDC Simulation

## Overview
This document outlines the design of an enhanced economic model for simulating a national economy that has adopted Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and programmable monetary policy. The model expands on the existing IS-LM framework to include additional real-world factors such as international trade, banking sector dynamics, and more granular control mechanisms enabled by CBDC technology.

## Core Economic Components

### 1. Macroeconomic Framework
- **Extended IS-LM-BP Model**: Incorporates balance of payments to model international capital flows
- **Aggregate Supply-Aggregate Demand**: Models price level determination and output
- **Phillips Curve**: Enhanced relationship between inflation and unemployment
- **Okun's Law**: Relationship between GDP growth and unemployment changes
- **Solow Growth Model**: Long-term economic growth components

### 2. Sectoral Components

#### Household Sector
- **Consumption Function**: C = C₀ + c(Y-T) * (1-conditional_spending_constraints)
- **Labor Supply**: Function of real wages, unemployment benefits, and labor market conditions
- **Savings Behavior**: Affected by interest rates, inflation expectations, and CBDC incentives
- **Wealth Effects**: Impact of asset prices on consumption
- **Demographic Factors**: Age distribution effects on economic behavior

#### Business Sector
- **Investment Function**: I = I₀ - b*r + smart_contract_lending + tech_innovation
- **Production Function**: Y = A * F(K,L) * (1-regulatory_burden)
- **Labor Demand**: Function of wages, productivity, and output
- **Capital Accumulation**: Δk = investment - depreciation
- **Technology Adoption**: Affects productivity and growth

#### Banking Sector
- **Credit Creation**: Multiplier effects with CBDC reserve requirements
- **Loan Provision**: Function of interest rates, risk assessment, and smart contract parameters
- **Interbank Market**: Liquidity distribution among financial institutions
- **Financial Stability Indicators**: Leverage ratios, liquidity coverage, etc.
- **Central Bank Operations**: Open market operations, reserve management

#### Government Sector
- **Fiscal Policy**: Government spending and taxation
- **Debt Management**: Bond issuance and servicing
- **Automatic Stabilizers**: Unemployment benefits, progressive taxation
- **Discretionary Spending**: Infrastructure, education, healthcare
- **Regulatory Framework**: Financial regulations, environmental policies

#### External Sector
- **Trade Balance**: Exports - Imports as function of exchange rates, tariffs, and global demand
- **Capital Flows**: Foreign investment influenced by interest rates and capital controls
- **Exchange Rate Determination**: Floating, managed, or fixed regimes
- **Tariffs and Customs**: Impact on trade volumes and domestic prices
- **International Reserves**: Management of foreign currency holdings

### 3. CBDC-Specific Components

#### Monetary Policy Tools
- **Interest Rate Management**: Tiered interest rates based on account types/balances
- **Money Supply Control**: Direct adjustment of CBDC issuance
- **Reserve Requirements**: Programmable reserve ratios for different institutions
- **Collateral Requirements**: Smart contract-enforced collateral for loans
- **Quantitative Easing/Tightening**: Programmable asset purchases

#### Programmable Money Features
- **Velocity Control**: Expiration dates on money (validity periods)
- **Conditional Spending**: Restrictions on use cases for certain funds
- **Automated Fiscal Transfers**: UBI, stimulus, or targeted subsidies
- **Geolocation Policies**: Region-specific monetary rules
- **Behavioral Incentives**: Rewards for desired economic behaviors

#### Financial System Controls
- **Capital Controls**: Restrictions on cross-border flows
- **Macroprudential Tools**: System-wide risk management
- **Crisis Response Mechanisms**: Emergency overrides during economic shocks
- **Compliance Automation**: AML/KYC and regulatory reporting
- **Privacy Settings**: Configurable transaction transparency

## Mathematical Framework

### Key Equations

1. **Extended IS Curve**:
   Y = C + I + G + NX
   Where:
   - C = C₀ + c(Y-T) * (1-conditional_spending_constraints)
   - I = I₀ - b*r + smart_contract_lending + tech_innovation
   - G = G₀ + automatic_fiscal_transfers
   - NX = X₀ - m*Y - tariff_effects - foreign_exchange_controls

2. **Extended LM Curve**:
   M/P = k*Y - h*r + cbdc_velocity_adjustment
   Where:
   - M = central_bank_money_supply * (1 + banking_multiplier)
   - P = price level
   - cbdc_velocity_adjustment = f(programmable_money_validity)

3. **Balance of Payments (BP) Curve**:
   BP = NX + CF = 0
   Where:
   - NX = net exports
   - CF = capital flows = f(r - r_foreign, capital_controls, exchange_rate_expectations)

4. **Enhanced Phillips Curve**:
   π = π_e - α(u - u_n) + supply_shocks + inflation_indexed_instruments

5. **Exchange Rate Determination**:
   e = f(r - r_foreign, NX, CF, central_bank_intervention)

6. **Banking Sector Equilibrium**:
   Loan_Supply = Loan_Demand
   Where:
   - Loan_Supply = f(deposits, reserve_requirements, interbank_rate)
   - Loan_Demand = f(investment, consumption, interest_rate, credit_worthiness)

7. **Tariff Effects on Trade**:
   Import_Volume = f(domestic_demand, relative_prices, tariff_rates)
   Export_Volume = f(foreign_demand, relative_prices, foreign_tariffs)

8. **CBDC Velocity**:
   V = transactions_volume / cbdc_supply * (1/programmable_money_validity)

### Feedback Mechanisms

1. **Inflation Expectations**:
   π_e(t+1) = f(π(t), central_bank_credibility, policy_transparency)

2. **Investment Confidence**:
   I_confidence = f(economic_stability, policy_predictability, growth_expectations)

3. **Consumer Sentiment**:
   C_sentiment = f(employment_security, real_wage_growth, wealth_effects)

4. **Financial Market Stability**:
   Stability_Index = f(leverage_ratios, liquidity_measures, interconnectedness)

5. **Policy Credibility**:
   Credibility = f(policy_consistency, transparency, goal_achievement)
