## Mathematical Framework

### 1. Banking System Equations

#### Bank Balance Sheet Identity
- **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**
- **Assets**: Reserves (R) + Loans (L) + Securities (S) + Other Assets (OA)
- **Liabilities**: Deposits (D) + Borrowings (B) + Other Liabilities (OL)
- **Equity**: Capital (K)

#### Deposit Creation Process
- **Money Multiplier**: m = 1 / reserve_ratio
- **Deposit Creation**: ΔD = initial_deposit * m
- **CBDC Impact**: m_CBDC = f(CBDC_design, reserve_requirements)
- **Deposit Competition**: D = f(r_deposit, r_CBDC, convenience, services)

#### Loan Supply Function
- **Basic Function**: L^s = f(r_loan, r_funding, capital, risk_perception)
- **Risk-Adjusted Return**: RAROC = (Revenue - Expected_Loss) / Economic_Capital
- **Capital Constraint**: L ≤ K / capital_requirement
- **Liquidity Constraint**: Liquid_Assets ≥ LCR * Short_Term_Outflows

### 2. Central Bank Policy Rules

#### Interest Rate Setting
- **Taylor Rule**: r = r* + α(π - π*) + β(Y - Y*)
- **CBDC Rate Setting**: r_CBDC = r_policy - spread
- **Corridor System**: r_lending ≥ r_policy ≥ r_deposit
- **Tiered Rate Structure**: r_CBDC(tier) = base_rate + tier_adjustment

#### Balance Sheet Management
- **Quantitative Easing**: ΔReserves = ΔCBDC + ΔSecurities_held
- **Bank Reserves**: R = Required_Reserves + Excess_Reserves
- **CBDC Issuance**: CBDC_supply = f(monetary_policy, financial_stability)
- **Sterilization Operations**: ΔOMO = -ΔCBDC (to neutralize money supply impact)

#### Financial Stability Indicators
- **Systemic Risk Index**: SRI = f(leverage, interconnectedness, concentration, volatility)
- **Stress Indicator**: SI = weighted_sum(market_stress, funding_stress, credit_stress)
- **Intervention Threshold**: If SI > threshold then activate_emergency_measures
- **Contagion Model**: Probability(bank_i_failure | bank_j_failure) = f(exposure_ij, correlation_ij)

### 3. Financial Market Dynamics

#### Interest Rate Term Structure
- **Expectations Hypothesis**: r_long = average(r_short_expected) + term_premium
- **Yield Curve**: r(t) = f(maturity, inflation_expectations, risk_premium)
- **CBDC Impact**: Yield_curve_shift = f(CBDC_rate, CBDC_quantity)
- **Term Premium**: TP = f(duration_risk, liquidity_premium, preferred_habitat)

#### Asset Pricing Models
- **CAPM**: E(r_i) = r_f + β_i(E(r_m) - r_f)
- **Arbitrage Pricing**: E(r_i) = r_f + Σ_j β_ij λ_j
- **Bond Pricing**: P = Σ_t CF_t / (1 + r_t)^t
- **CBDC Effects**: Asset_price = f(discount_rate, cash_flow, liquidity, CBDC_policy)

#### Market Liquidity Measures
- **Bid-Ask Spread**: S = Ask_price - Bid_price
- **Market Depth**: D = Volume / Price_Impact
- **Resilience**: R = Recovery_Speed_After_Shock
- **Liquidity Index**: LI = f(S, D, R, trading_volume)
